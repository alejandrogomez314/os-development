This repository contains the code I used in conjunction with the book "Writing a Simple Operating System â€” from Scratch" by Nick Blundell. 

## Tools
I used nasm for assembling my code into binary, qemu-system-x86_64 for emulating a bare x86 machine (though the programming assumed backwards-compatability with an 8086 processor).


## Contents
`boot_code` contains boot sector programming.
